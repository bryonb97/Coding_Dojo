// Fibonacci - Create a function to generate Fibonacci numbers.  In this famous mathematical sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with values 0 and 1.  Your function should accept one argument, an index into the sequence (where 0 corresponds to the initial value, 4 corresponds to the value four later, etc).  Examples: fibonacci(0) = 0 (given), fibonacci(1) = 1 (given), fibonacci(2) = 1 (fib(0)+fib(1), or 0+1), fibonacci(3) = 2 (fib(1) + fib(2)3, or 1+1), fibonacci(4) = 3 (1+2), fibonacci(5) = 5 (2+3), fibonacci(6) = 8 (3+5), fibonacci(7) = 13 (5+8).  Do this without using recursion first.  If you don't know what a recursion is yet, don't worry as we'll be introducing this concept in Part 2 of this assignment.

function fib(num){
    var arr = [0,1];
    while(arr.length <= num){
        arr.push(arr[arr.length - 1] + arr[arr.length - 2]);
    }
    return arr[arr.length - 1];
}
fib(6);
